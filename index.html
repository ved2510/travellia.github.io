                        <p class="card-text">Dudhsagar Falls ('Sea of Milk') is a four-tiered waterfall located on
                            the Mandovi River in the Indian state of Goa. It is 60 km from Panaji by road and is located
                            on the Belgaum Vasco Da Gama rail route about 46 km east of Madgaon and 80 km south of
                            Belgaum. Dudhsagar Falls is amongst India's tallest waterfalls with a height of 310 m (1017
                            feet) and an average width of 30 metres (100 feet).
                            The falls are a punctuation mark in the journey of the Mandovi River from the
                            Western Ghats to Panjim where it meets the Arabian sea. The area is surrounded by deciduous
                            forests with rich biodiversity. This waterfall is also known as Tambdi Surla to some of the
                            local people. The falls are not particularly spectacular during the dry season but during
                            the <b>monsoon season</b>, however, the falls are fed by rains and form a huge force of
                            water.</p>

                            inaugurated on Mahashivaratri, 24 February 2017, by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra
                            Modi. The statue depicts Shiva as the first yogi or Adiyogi, and first Guru or Adi Guru,
                            who offered yoga to humanity. It was built by the Isha Foundation using 20,000 individual
                            iron plates supplied by the Steel Authority of India and weighs around 500 tonnes (490 long
                            tons; 550 short tons). It has been recognised as the "Largest Bust Sculpture" by Guinness
